        <h2>What Is Cloud Computing?</h2>
        <p>
          Cloud computing basically means accessing technology resources like servers, storage, databases,
            networking, and even full applications over the internet, only when you need them and usually with
            pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying and maintaining your own hardware, a cloud provider handles
            all of that for you.
      </p>

        <p>
            This makes technology more flexible, scalable, and affordable, especially for beginners or small teams
            who don’t want to set up physical infrastructure.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Cloud Service Models</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud services are usually offered in three main models. Each one shifts how much you manage
            versus how much the provider handles.
